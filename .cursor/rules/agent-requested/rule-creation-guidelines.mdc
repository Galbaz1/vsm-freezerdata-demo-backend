# Cursor Rule Creation Guidelines

## Rule Types

| Type | Metadata | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Always** | `alwaysApply: true` | Core architectural principles applied to all work |
| **Auto-Attached** | `globs: ["path/**"]` + `alwaysApply: false` | Rules for specific directories/file patterns |
| **Agent-Requested** | `description: "..."` + `alwaysApply: false` | Rules agent can choose to include based on description |
| **Manual** | No globs, no description, `alwaysApply: false` | Rules user explicitly references with `@ruleName` |

## Directory Structure

```
.cursor/rules/
├── always/                    # alwaysApply: true rules only
├── auto-attached/             # Rules with globs
├── agent-requested/           # Rules with descriptions
└── manual/                    # Explicit-use rules
```

## Rule Anatomy

```yaml
---
description: "Short description for agent-requested rules"
globs:
  - "features/*/**"           # Glob patterns for auto-attached rules
alwaysApply: false            # true only for always/ folder rules
---

# Rule Title

Content should be:
- Concise (< 500 lines)
- Actionable (clear boundaries, not vague advice)
- Specific (concrete examples, not abstractions)
```

## When to Use Each Type

**Always Applied** (keep minimal):
- Vertical slicing principles
- Naming conventions
- Core architectural invariants

**Auto-Attached** (path-scoped):
- Per-feature slice boundaries
- Shared module constraints
- Directory-specific scaffolding

**Agent-Requested** (contextual):
- Documentation navigation
- Domain-specific patterns
- Framework-specific guidelines

**Manual** (explicit):
- Rare workflows
- Experimental patterns
- Project-specific templates

## Writing Effective Rules

**Do:**
- Provide concrete boundaries and constraints
- Include minimal examples
- Reference tool/file patterns explicitly
- Keep rules under 500 lines

**Don't:**
- Explain why rules exist (rule = tool, not documentation)
- Overlap with other rules
- Use vague guidance ("consider", "maybe")
- Bloat always-applied rules with details
