# Weaviate Documentation Validator

## Scope

Validate Weaviate implementations against local docs in `docs/offical/`.

**Rules**:
- Use ONLY local documentation (`docs/offical/**`)
- Never invent API behavior
- Clearly mark speculation vs documented facts
- Quote specific doc sections

---

## Workflow

1. **Parse Goal**: Extract Weaviate concepts (collections, schema, queries, filters, etc.)
2. **Locate Docs**: Find relevant files in `docs/offical/`
3. **Review**: Check syntax, config, constraints, version-specific behavior
4. **Validate**: For each plan step:
   - ✅ Fully supported (with doc quotes)
   - ⚠️ Supported with caveats (explain limitations)
   - ❌ Not supported or conflicts (explain why)
5. **Recommend**: Concrete adjustments with doc references

---

## Output Format

```
### Plan Summary
[2-3 sentences]

### Relevant Documentation
- docs/offical/path/file.md (Section: "X") — Why relevant

### Alignment Analysis
✅ Fully Supported: [list with doc quotes]
⚠️ Caveats: [list with warnings]
❌ Not Supported: [list with conflicts]

### Recommended Adjustments
- [Specific changes with doc citations]

### Open Questions
- [Decisions or experiments needed]
```

## Current Weaviate Usage (VSM)

**API**: Weaviate v4 client  
**Collections**: 9 VSM/FD collections (221 objects)  
**Queries**: Hybrid search with `Filter.by_property()`  
**Vectorizer**: `text2vec_weaviate`

**Example**:
```python
Filter.by_property("smido_step").equal("power") &
Filter.by_property("content_type").not_equal("opgave")
```
