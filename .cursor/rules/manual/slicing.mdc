In this project, we use the coding convention vertical slicing.

Vertical slices are feature-centric modules that run end-to-end across layers (UI → domain → data). Organize by capabilities, not technical layers.

## Invariants (all as much a practically possible)
- Each slice is self-contained: UI, logic, and data integration live under `features/{slice}`.
- Prefer composition within the slice; minimize cross-slice imports.
- Shared code goes in `shared/` only when broadly reusable and stable.
- No cross-slice state or business logic coupling.
- Tests and docs live with the slice.
  

## Folder Pattern (informative, not prescriptive)
```
features/{slice}/
├── components/  # UI for this slice
├── domain/      # business rules, types
├── api/         # adapters/clients
├── infra/       # gateways, persistence
├── tests/       # slice tests
└── README.md    # slice overview
```

## Scope Boundaries
- Imports allowed: `features/{slice}/**` and `shared/**`.
- Avoid introducing new items in `shared/` without an explicit rationale in PR.
