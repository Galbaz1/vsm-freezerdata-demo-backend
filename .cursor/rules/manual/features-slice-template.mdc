# Feature Slice Rule

## Boundaries
- Allowed imports: `features/{slice}/**`, `shared/**`
- Avoid cross-slice imports (`features/other-slice/**`) unless explicitly justified in PR

## Guidance
- Co-locate UI, domain, API, infra, tests, and docs in this slice
- Prefer composition and internal helpers over extracting to `shared/`
- Scaffold new elements with minimal tests and a short README update
