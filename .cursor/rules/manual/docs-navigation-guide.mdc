# Documentation Navigation Guide

Quick reference for RAG and Context Engineering documentation in `docs/`.

## Context Engineering Series (`docs/context_engineering/`)

**Purpose:** Design tool responses and interaction patterns for agentic systems.

| File | Topic | When to Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `context-engineering-index.md` | Series overview & fundamentals | Start here for context engineering concepts |
| `context-engineering-tool-response.md` | Faceted search & structured responses | Building tool outputs, designing agent peripheral vision |
| `context-engineering-agent-frameworks.md` | Framework selection (chatbot vs workflow vs artifact) | Choosing architecture, autonomy spectrum decisions |
| `context-engineering-slash-commands.md` | Prompt injection patterns | Designing custom commands, IDE integrations |
| `context-engineering-compaction.md` | Token optimization techniques | Managing context windows, compressing information |
| `context-engineering-rapid-prototyping.md` | Fast iteration strategies | Accelerating development, testing patterns |

**Core Concepts:** Tool response design, faceted search, agent peripheral vision, structured metadata, context windows.

## Series Relationships

```
Context Engineering
├── Builds on RAG fundamentals
├── Focus: Agent-centric design
└── Complements: Tool response structure

RAG Master Series
├── Foundation for Context Engineering
├── Focus: Retrieval & generation quality
└── Complements: Traditional RAG patterns
```

**Note:** Both series cross-reference each other. Context Engineering applies RAG principles to agentic systems.

## Usage Tips

1. **Start broad**: Index files provide overviews
2. **Follow cross-refs**: Files link to related concepts
3. **Practical first**: Low-hanging fruit and tips before advanced topics
4. **Case studies**: Look for "Raindrop" and "Skylar" for real examples
5. **Series order**: Not required but helpful for foundational concepts
