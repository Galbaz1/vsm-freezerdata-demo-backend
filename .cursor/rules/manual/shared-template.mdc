# Shared Module Rule

## Purpose
- Host truly reusable, stable primitives (UI atoms, types, utilities)
- No domain-specific logic; no slice coupling

## Boundaries
- Do not import from `features/**`
- Keep APIs small, well-typed, and documented

## Guidance
- If adding new shared code, include rationale in PR and note impacted slices
- Favor internal slice composition before promoting to `shared/`
